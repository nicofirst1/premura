# Contract — intake `runtime_valid` (the bounded runtime subset)

> Satisfies FR-010 / SC-008. `runtime_valid` is a **bounded runtime-checkable subset**, explicitly **NOT** the full parser-review contract (`src/premura/parsers/CONTRACT.md`).

## Observation form (UNCHANGED — `check_runtime_contract`, verbatim)

The four shipped clauses, recomputed by the grader (pinned to the live function):

1. `no_derived_emitted` — no emitted metric_id is in the reserved `derived:` namespace.
2. `declared_equals_emitted` — the declared metric set equals the emitted metric set.
3. `declared_exist_in_dim_metric` — every declared metric exists in `dim_metric`.
4. `produced_batch_without_raising` — the ingest produced a batch (the run did not fail).

## Intake form (NEW — `check_intake_runtime_contract`)

The analogue, defined against `IntakeBatch` (which has **no** metric_id / `dim_metric` / emitted-metric surface; it has nutrition/supplement events, `source_descriptors`, `unmapped_metrics`, `skipped_rows`, and `validate()`):

1. `parser_imports_and_parses` — the parser module imports and `parse()` returns an `IntakeBatch` (or a `ParseOutput` carrying one) **without raising**.
2. `batch_validates` — `IntakeBatch.validate()` passes: every event `source_id` is covered by a declared `source_descriptor`, and there are no duplicate `dedupe_key`s.
3. `persisted_without_raising` — `persist_intake_batch` loads the batch without raising.

`runtime_valid = (no violations)`; `violations` is a sorted list of `"<clause>: <detail>"` strings (same shape as the observation result, feeding the unchanged verdict schema).

### Evidence inputs (the producer/consumer seam — both in WP02)

The checker is the **consumer**; the in-sandbox runner is the **producer**, and both live in WP02 so there is no cross-WP gap. The runner emits its outcome in the **existing** envelope fields — `status` (`"ok"`/`"error"`) and a **stage-tagged `error`** string — so **no new envelope key** is added and the frozen `ingest-outcome-envelope.schema.json` (`additionalProperties:false`) is unchanged:

| Clause                      | Witnessed by                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parser_imports_and_parses` | `status=="ok"`, or `error` whose stage ≠ `parse`                                                                |
| `batch_validates`           | `error` whose stage ≠ `validate` (the runner now calls `IntakeBatch.validate()` explicitly — today it does not) |
| `persisted_without_raising` | `error` whose stage ≠ `persist`                                                                                 |

Error stages are `"parse: …"` / `"validate: …"` / `"persist: …"`. The runner is harness code witnessing the operator's batch — not a parser self-report. WP06 (provenance) and WP07 (probe) only carry `status`/`error` through; they do not define this seam.

### Where intake declared/emitted lives (the named evidence surface)

Observation's `declared_equals_emitted` compares **canonical metric keys**. `IntakeBatch` has **none** (`src/premura/parsers/base.py:282-330`: it has `nutrition_events`, `supplement_events`, `source_descriptors`, per-event `source_id` + `dedupe_key`, `unmapped_metrics`, `skipped_rows` — but no `declared_metrics` / `emitted_metric_ids` / `dim_metric`). So:

- Clauses 1–3 of the **observation** check (`no_derived_emitted`, `declared_equals_emitted`, `declared_exist_in_dim_metric`) have **no intake counterpart by design** — do not invent a fake canonical-metric mirror.
- The truthful intake declared/emitted coherence is on the **source dimension**: _declared_ = `source_descriptors`; _emitted_ = the `source_id`s used on events; `validate()` enforces declared-covers-emitted + `dedupe_key` uniqueness (clause 2).

The intake evidence seam for `runtime_valid` is therefore **`source_descriptors` / event `source_id` / event `dedupe_key`** — a primitive that already exists, named here so the check cannot drift into either a fake metric surface or the full review contract.

## Invariants

- The clause **names and count** in this contract MUST match the implementation; a test asserts this so the spec cannot drift from the checker (FR-010).
- `runtime_valid` MUST NOT be widened to any clause from the full parser-review contract.
- The grader's persisted `contract_pass` is this recomputed `runtime_valid`, never an operator/runner self-report (FR-005).
